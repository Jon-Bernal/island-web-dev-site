## Tools

### Mage (MageFiles)

Description: Similar to makefiles, however it allows for more flexability than makefiles.

[Install instructions](https://magefile.org/)

### CompileDaemon

Description: Similar to nodemon if you've worked with nodejs. Basically this watches files within the project and recompiles whenever any changes are made to those files. A script to run the dev setup will be provided in the mage file (once I've made the mage file)

<!-- Todo: remove this once mage file is created -->
