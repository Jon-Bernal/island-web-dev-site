      <h2>About Jon Bernal</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! I'm Jon Bernal, a seasoned freelance web developer with a
        passion for crafting digital experiences that blend functionality and
        creativity. With a rich background in software engineering, I've honed
        my skills through impactful roles, including a senior software engineer
        position at Guild Education and valuable contributions to the dynamic
        world of startups like Nowigence.
      </p>

      <h3>Tech Maestro</h3>
      <p>
        Having navigated both the backend and frontend realms of web
        development, I bring a decade of expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and
        JavaScript. My proficiency extends to advanced technologies,
        encompassing 4 years of hands-on experience with TypeScript, Node.js,
        React.js, Svelte, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Digital Ocean. My
        commitment to staying at the forefront of technology ensures that I
        deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed contemporary industry
        standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
      <p>
        My journey started in the enterprise-level landscape with Guild
        Education, where I played a key role in developing robust software
        solutions. Transitioning to the startup scene at Nowigence, I embraced
        the challenges of full-stack engineering, further shaping my adaptable
        skill set.
      </p>

      <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
      <p>
        While coding fuels my professional life, my personal interests extend
        far beyond the screen. You might find me conquering trails during a
        morning run, scaling rock faces for a dose of adrenaline, or immersed in
        the world of hand tool woodworking. When I'm not crafting code, I'm
        crafting tangible pieces with my hands.
      </p>

      <h3>Let's Build Together</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're a business seeking a dynamic web presence or a fellow
        enthusiast eager to collaborate on exciting projects, I'm here to bring
        your visions to life. Let's embark on a journey where creativity meets
        functionality, and where your digital aspirations become reality.
